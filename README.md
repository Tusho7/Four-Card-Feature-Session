## Overview

In this project I mainly needed to focus on page layout and page responsiveness.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site

## My process

Create Header
Add title and text
Create second section
Create boxes
Add icons
Give boxes styles in CSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media Queries

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained more practise of using Media Queries, the main challenge that I overcame was to create responsive page that would work on mobile and desktop and create layout of images and texts specifically like it is shown in design. 

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master coding and make more dynamic,interactive and responsive projects.
